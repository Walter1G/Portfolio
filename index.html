        <h1>Web Development</h1>

        <p style="font-size: large; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites or web applications that run on the internet. Web development involves both front-end and back-end aspects, as well as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management123.

            Front-end development is the part of web development that deals with the user interface, or the part of the website that users see and interact with. Front-end developers use technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various frameworks and libraries to create the layout, appearance, and functionality of web pages12.
            
            Back-end development is the part of web development that deals with the server side, or the part of the website that users cannot see and interact with. Back-end developers use technologies such as PHP, Java, Python, Node.js, and various databases to store and retrieve data, handle requests, and perform logic for web applications12.
            
            Web development is important because websites and web applications are essential for many businesses, organizations, and individuals to communicate, share information, provide services, and reach a wider audience. Web development is also a dynamic and creative field that offers many opportunities for learning new skills and technologies.</p>
